4) Why Care About Form - bad-good-forms.jpeg

- form Properties we care about

Good Forms

- user can quickly finish
- input fields have place holders that prompt user on entering correct input
- the fonts on the input fields are visible and big
- there is a progress bar that indicates what you've done, where are are curently, and what's left
- 

Bad Forms

- hard to finish (i.e. long)
- small fonts
- no progress indicator

5) The Principles of Useful Forms

- remember the goal of your form is to get a conversion
- that means, a new user signs up or makes a purchase
- most effective strategy is to make forms quick and easy to finish

5a) Amazon's One Click Ordering

- best example of a super fast (i.e quick and easy to finish) form
- down side is it only works for some products and only if the user is already signed in

5b) Other Useful Form Properties

useful labels
pronged validation
progress indicators

- these build customer confidence
- thus, conversions go up

6) Pre-Fill Some Input with Information You Aleady HAve about User

- gets user closer to finishing form

6a) Postal Code

- use user exisitng data from last login
- use gelocation in browser - works even if the user is not logged in 

6b) Date of Birth

6c) Enable Autofill on Form Input
 
7) Death to Dropdowns

- dropdowns make for bad UX - I only see this being a problem on mobile
- many taps to make a selection
- basically avoid them; there are better input types

8) HTML5 Inputs Types - Much better Options than Dropdown

tel
url
email

- on mobile these types will bring up appropriate input interface

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist

9) When is it approriate to use a dropdown 

- to give users a predefined list of options
- but can be inconvienient when ther are too many options
- and they are not flexible as user can only choose one of the options

9a) Datalist = select = text input

- combines helpfulness of predefined list with the flexibility of a text input

9b) Datalist Syntax

- consist of input + datalist + option elements
- the inputs 'list' attribute must match the datalist "id" attribute
 
<input list="nanodegrees">
<datalist id="nanodegrees">
  <option value="Android"></option>
  <option value="Data Analyst"></option>
  <option value="Front End"></option>
  <option value="Full Stack"></option>
  <option value="Intro to Programming"></option>
  <option value="iOS"></option>
  <option value="Tech Entrepreneur"></option>
</datalist>

10) The Perfect Form

- NO FORMS!!!! Don't use forms if you don't have to

11) Ways to Predict What Your Users Will Type
