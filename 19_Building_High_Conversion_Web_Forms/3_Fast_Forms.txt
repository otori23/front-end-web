1) So Far

- build better input by pick the right type for the situataion
- enabled autocomplete, require, validation
- now look at the form as a whole
- really importnatn for ecommerce
- main goal is to minimize the amount of time your use spends filling out forms

2) For Principles

- make forms as short and sweet as possible (no redundancies and enable autocomplete)
- provide healpful prompts (via labels, etc) 
- provide immediate feedback (via require, validation, progress bar, etc)

2a) Form Principles Deck

http://www.slideshare.net/greenido/web-forms-the-right-way

- really want to understand how your user experiences the form:
how long will it take
can I save my progress and finish later
can I start on one device and finish on another

- most important thing is to give your users the option to finish later

3) LukeW Interview Part5 - Testing New Forms

- you want to really think about what your form looks to people outside the organization
- e.g. legal, marketing, database structure, etc have their requirements so a simple form becomes bloated

- good technique is to have a real person play the role of the form, and have a conversation with the person and see how information flows and is exchanged

4) Don't Force Registration before Purchasing

- have option to checkout as a guest
- registration gates really just push users away

4a) Practices that Most Likely Drive Users Away

- registration gates on checkout

5) Finish on another Device - Save to Shopping Cart

- people use mobile device when on the go; and thier laptops when at home
- people will visit thesame site on both devices
- people typically shop in public on their mobile device; but wait until they get home to pay
- saving to a shopping cart is the way to go

6) From Quiz - http://udacity.github.io/course-web-forms/lesson3/bigForm1/start/

- what are potential areas of improvement?
- how would you make this form faster
- how would you make this form simpler]
- remember:  Fast Forms = More Conversions

some information seems unnecessary:
middle initial, age, gender, no autofill, no validation, 
option to use same address for billing and shipping

7) One Wierd Trick - Location

- can use a devices location to speed up the checkout process

7a) Entering Address Information is Extremely Annoying

- no uniform format for entering an address
- also they require several input fields

7b) Autofill using GPS or WiFi

- address can be easily generated on mobile devices as they have gps or wifi
- can use the gps or wifi info to auto fill address to a close approximation of actual value

7c) Autofill using Previously Saved Address

- can use autofill option to retrieve an address that was previously saved in the browser

8) Quiz: Build A Checkout

8a) Local Versions Of Solution

checkout-start	 	:original source
checkout-polymer 	:polymer-based solution
checkout-solution 	:native html based solution

8b) Live Versions of Solutions

http://udacity.github.io/course-web-forms/lesson3/bigForm1/start/
https://udacity.github.io/course-web-forms/lesson3/bigForm1/polymer/dest/
http://udacity.github.io/course-web-forms/lesson3/bigForm1/solution/

8c) Install and Run the Polymer Checkout Form:

- Unzip lesson3-quizBigForm1-polymer.zip and cd into it
- Install npm, bower and gulp if you haven't already
- Run npm install
- Run bower install
- Host over localhost and open dest/index.html in your browser
- As you make your edits to the files in src/, use gulp watch to watch for changes and rebuild to dest/.

8d) Solution Notes

native

- used place holder instead of labels
- labels are still in the DOM for screen readers, but they are hidden

ploymer

- has a progress bar up top
- uses geolocation to fill out 

9) Ploymer - Gold Elements

- used ploymers gold elements to desing check out form
- gold elements are good for ecommerce???
- research more on ploymer material design

10) LukeW Mobile First

- huge opportunity; many users
- new capabilities - gps, multi-touch, sensors, etc
- think really hard about what fits on the small real estate of the screen; so mobile forces you to think about what really matters

11) Outro

- short forms
- don't ask for redundant information
- give feedback
- use location services to help with address
