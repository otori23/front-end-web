1) CSS framworks
Bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com/ 
Foundation: http://foundation.zurb.com/ 
Yaml: http://www.yaml.de/ 
960 Grid: http://960.gs/ 
Suzy: http://susy.oddbird.net/ 
Frameless: http://framelessgrid.com/

What design decision are made when picking a css framework?
Basically what are the properties of framework and how well do it match my needs

2) Bootstrap offerings
- The framework is divided into categories: CSS, Components, JavaScript
- Bootstrap is a huge framework so, you'll almost never need all it offers
- A user can pick and choose what parts of the bootstrap system to download and use (see Customize link)
- for our little class project, we used: 

Common CSS: Typography and Grid system
Components: none
JavaScript components: Modals

3) Minified files
- remove all whitespace so that they are smaller than the original
- always include minified versions of your files on your site for faster downloads

4) Class Notes

To use the Bootstrap files in your project just copy the css and js folders to your project folder. Don't forget to include the files in your head element:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap.min.css"> 
<script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

NOTE: CSS minification does not happen automatically by default, therefore if you edit your unminified CSS file, but include the minified version in your HTML, the page will not use the updated CSS by default.

You can manually minify your CSS using a site like http://cssminifier.com/.

You can also use a more advanced and automated workflow where CSS files get minimized automatically, for example using a plugin for your code editor or a build system like Gruntjs.

5) Custom CSS
Can use bootstrap in addition to custom CSS. Use bootstrap for big general stuff and your custom CSS for the smaller more specific stuff

6) alt text
Always set alt attribute on img tags

7) Web development work flow concept
- use Bootstrap to get general layout down
- use custom css for your exact fonts, colors, and all things specific to your design
- for smaller projets organize csss rules from most general at top of file (e.g. body) to most specific at bottom of file.

8) Linking to style sheets
- The order in which you link to stylesheets is important
- The latest stylesheets override the previous stylesheets

9) Modal windows
A modal window is any type of window that is a child (secondary window) to a parent window and usurps the parent's control. It is commonly associated with an Internet Web site pop-up window that stays in front of the original window.  A user may not press any controls or enter any information on the parent window (the original window which opened the modal) until the modal has been closed. A modal window is commonly used when the author wants to retain the user's focus on the information in the modal as it is impossible for the user to interact with the other windows of the same process.

10) Semantics (noun)
The branch of linguistics and logic concerned with meaning.
