Project Requirements for Cat Clicker

1) Visuals

- The application should display a picture of a cat and a number of clicks.
- The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

2) Interaction

- The number of clicks should increment when the cat picture is clicked.

3) Resources

In case you need a refresher on events and event listeners, here are some links.

a) If you're writing Cat Clicker with vanilla JS (no jQuery), you'll be adding the "click" event with 
elem.addEventListener().

var elem = document.getElementById('my-elem');
elem.addEventListener('click', function(){
  //the element has been clicked... do stuff here
}, false);

b) If you're using jQuery, you'll be adding the "click" event listener with jQuery.click().

$('#my-elem').click(function(e) {
  //the element has been clicked... do stuff here
});
