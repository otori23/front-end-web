0) Introduction
- look at how to use the audio apis for the web to make your games stand out

1) Sound and WebAudio
- sound travels as a wave through the air
- it is an analog signal
- convert to digital form so that computer can use it
- computer can apply several transforms to the digital form of the sound
- i.e. change volume or apply an echo effect
- think of all the transforms as a graph of processing nodes (sound_0.jpeg)
- can traverse the graph in several different ways to combine unit transforms in more complex transforms
- web audio is a node graph contained in something called an audio context
- the audio context is run natively in high performance code specifically designed for audio processing

1b) http://webaudioplayground.appspot.com/
- great web app for playing with sound and effects
- built by Chris Wilson
- great way to visualize how web audio works
- add source nodes, procession nodes, there is an output node (the speaker)
- instructor shows how to create slap back effect
- code available on GitHub
- https://github.com/cwilso/WebAudio
- app is hosted on google's appEngine

2) Planning for your game
- What sound effects do we need for GRITs ?
- play basic sound clips
- adjust the volume based on game state
- i.e. can adjust volume os sounds based on distance from player on screen
- so if something happens far away from player sound is not so loud
- but if it happens close to player, sound is pretty loud
- this provides a much more realistic environment than you could achieve with the audio element
- can add pretty complex sound effects to your game
- GRITs will use basic volume controls
- But, you need to decide what level of sound complexity is right for your game

3) Getting Sounds into Your Game
- can pay a sound designer
- but if your are a startup maybe you can't afford one
- can get sounds for free - but be aware of licensing restricitons: creative commons, attribution, etc
- sounds from different source/designers may not sound cohesive inside of your game
- so, you probably need to take you sounds inside of a post processing tool
- instructors fav: Gold Wave
- Gold Wave is free
- can cut, trim, your sounds to make it sound like everything was created in one environment
- just keep in mind it can be tricky to get great content into your game

4) Sound Manager
- GRITs does not need all the features of web audio
- so create an abstraction layer to hide complexity; process graph looks like
- sound -> gain -> out
- so create a sound manager class
