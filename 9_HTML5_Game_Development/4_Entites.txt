0) Story so far
- have ability to draw things on screen
- have ability to move them around
- give thought, work, and automation to an enviroment
- leads to concept on an entity

1) What is an entity ?
- pretty much every game architecture out there has some encompasing object
- object has logic assosciated with it
- object may or may not have a visual representation
- object may or may not be represented on the server
- this is a basic object that every game has
- call this object an entity

- is it a base class for the game components/entites? I think YES.
 
- class that contains some unique logic that makes this entity different from all the other ones in the world
- what type of properties should all entities have ?
- the ability to think or have some custom processing associated with an entity is critical to its definition

2) Creating an Entity 
- javascript eval
- works like python eval
- turns input string into executable code

3) Factory pattern
- use factory object to automate the creation of entities
