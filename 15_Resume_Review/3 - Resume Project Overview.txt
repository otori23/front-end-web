Resume Project Overview

Now that you have created (or updated!) your resume so that it has a concise, clear, and compelling story of the best aspects of yourself and that is thoughtfully targeted for the job you’re applying for and formatted so that recruiters can easily read it, you are ready to submit it for review!

Why This Resume Project?

On average recruiters take 6 seconds to read a resume and initially decide if a candidate is “fit” or “unfit.” An awesome resume is a crucial part of your preparation for the job hunt. It's not hard to write a compelling resume, but many candidates get tripped up by small mistakes.

What Will I Do?

You will update your resume according to the conventions that recruiters expect and get tips on how to best represent yourself to pass the 6 second screen. You will also make sure that your resume is appropriately targeted for the job you’re applying for.
