1) Documentation for jQuery object
- http://api.jquery.com/
- Documentation is organized in the left hand navigation according actions you may want to perform
 
2) jQuery thoughts
- $ (aka the jQuery object) is an object of type function
- Can invoke the function like $()
- invoking the function returns a collection of dom elements that match the input selector
- 


3) Another way of thinking about jQuery
- jQuery object has alias $
- jQuery object is a collection (i.e. array/list) of one or more DOM elements
- Create a jQuery object using the "class" constructor i.e 
jQueryObject = jQuery('selector'); // same as jQueryObject = $('selector');
- Can then call methods on the created jQuery object, i.e. jQueryObject.method()

4) .css()
- Changes the css in the sytle attribute of DOM element.
- Maybe not such a good idea, as this breaks the abstraction of sturcture/style/behaviour
- may be use .toggleClass() in combination with css files

5) .attr()
- Dynamically get/set attributes on DOM elements

6) .html() .text() .val()
get and set content of DOM elements

7) .remove()
- remove DOM elements

8) .append() .prepend() .insertBefore() .insertAfter()
- create and add new DOM elements (with one method call)
- vanilla js would require several method calls

9) jQuery method delegates
When inside a jQuery object methods delegate, you can access the current DOM element being processed as:
- $(this) - jQuery wrapper for vanilla JS DOM element
- The element parameter passed into the delegate - vanilla JS DOM element

10) Advantages of using jQuery
- Fast Selection
- Easy DOM Manipulation
- Cross-Browser Compatibility

11) JQuery and document.ready event (http://api.jquery.com/jquery/#jQuery3)
A function passed into the jQuery object runs on document.ready, which occurs after the DOM has been loaded.

$(function() {
  // Document is ready
});

External JavaScript files in the <head> of a document are generally downloaded earlier than JavaScript files included in the <body>. JavaScript files are also executed immediately at their location in the document, which means they can't access any DOM elements that come after their <script> tag in the DOM. This leads to some interesting situations.

12) Quiz
Trying out $(function)

For this quiz, can you modify a script in the <head> of index.html (called app.js) to
change the placeholder image in Article #1 to picture of a puppy?

here's a URL for a picture of a puppy: http://placepuppy.it/350/150
