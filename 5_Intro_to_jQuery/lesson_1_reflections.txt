1) jQuery.js is a Javascript library
- which means it is not a language on its own

2) jQuery exists because manipulating the DOM with vanilla JS is not easy;
Also, allows client to focus on UX and not browser compatibility issues

3) jQuery -> a function (also object) included in you site when you link to the jQuery library

4) $ -> an alais for the jQuery function (also object) 
- $ is just a javascript variable, you can reassign the value to something else
- BUT DO NOT

5) Print jQuery or $ to console and see how they are defined  

6) mootools (mootools.net)
Another javascript library

7) So what is the jQuery object (i.e. $)?
- $ -> jQuery Collection is like an array but with additional methods
> $

- Can pass in strings, functions, DOM Element to jQuery object
> $(string), $(function), $(DOM Element) : log results to console to see what is returned
- can call jQuery methods on whatever is returned

- Can call methods on the jQuery object
$.ajax() - > Abstarcts away annoying nuances of ajax

8) The DOM
- A data structure that can best be described as a tree

9) Including jQuery in your project
You have options
- locally (i.e. your own server): <script src='js/jquery.min.js'></script>
- from jQuery: <script src='//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js'></script>
- Content Delivery Networks(CDNs) like Google:
<script src='//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js'></script>

- CDNs are recommended
- use the minified version in production code as it is way smaller that regular version ->
faster page loads

10) Select a collection of DOM elements
$('tag')
$('.class')
$('#id')
- $: jQuery object; input string: jQuery selector which are also valid css selectors

- more likely you will be selecting DOM elements by classes

11) DOM traversal methods
$('#id').parent()
	.parents() -> can pass in selector here to filter for more specific result
	.children() -> immediate childern -> can pass selector
	.find() -> all decendants -> must pass in a selector, typically use "*" for all decendants
	.siblings() -> can pass in selector here to filter for more specific result

- Read their documentation
