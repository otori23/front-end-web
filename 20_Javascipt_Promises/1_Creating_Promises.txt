1) Intro

- every web developer needs to be able to handle asynchronous request with confidence and ease
- many way to handle asynchronous calls already
- native javascript promises are the recommended way
- they are flexible, have intuitie syntax and error handling

1a) Class Goals

- use promises to request json data from exeternal source (nasa, caltech)

2) Callbacks vs Promises

- the promise object is used for deferred and asynchronous computations - MDN

2a) What is Asynchronous Work?

var file = get('file.json');

- work that happens at an unknown or asynchronous time

2b) Normal Synchronous Code

- code that executes in a single unbroken timeline

var planetName = 'Kepler22b';
console.log(planetName); //Kepler22b

- one line of code executes and ...
- there is a guarantee that the next line executes immediately afterwards

2c) Asynchronous Code

- not guaranteed to execute in a single unbroken timeline

var file1 = get('file1.json');
var file2 = get('file2.json');

console.log(file1); //undefined
console.log(file2); //undefined

- programmer has no idea when an asynchronous operation will complete
- in the snippet you don't know which get request will return first

3) Examples of Asynchronous Code

- network requests
- events
- threads
- something with an unknown finishing time

4) Callbacks vs Thens

- callbacks are default way to handle asynchronous work
- it is called at some later time when some condition is met

function loadImage(src, parent, callback) {
  var img = document.createElement('img');
  img.src = src;
  img.onload = callback; // called at some later time; i.e. after image is fully loaded
  parent.appendChild(img);
}

5) Issues/Questions with Callbacks

5a) how do you handle error?

- any operation can fail at anytime; especially with network requests

5b) how do you create a sequence of work?

- what if the callback itself performs an asynchronous request
- can lead to situation with several levels of nested callbacks; aka pyramid of doom
- leads to unmaintainable code: very hard o refactor or debug

6) Compare Code Written with Callbacks vs Promises

6a) Callbacks

get('example.json', function() {
  doSomething(function() {
    doSomethinElse();
  });
});

6b) Promises

var sequence = get('example.json');
  .then(doSomething)
  .then(doSomethingElse);

- nice clean sequence of events

7) Course Map

- course is broken down into four stages that build on one another

Wrapping Stage 	- create the promise that wraps the unit of work you want to do
Thening Stage 	- do follow up work after the promise resolves
Catching Stage  - do follow up work after the promise rejects
Chaning Stage

7a) Wrapping Stage

- learn syntax of constructing promises
- a promise constructor by itself is not super useful

7b) Thening Stage

- learn how to react to the resolution of a promise
- e.g. get result of asynchronous work and preform other actions

7c) Catching Stage

- handle errors in the asynchronous work
- e.g. recover

7d) Chaning Stage

- learn how to create long sequences of asynchronous work
- the focus of 2nd lesson

8) Jake Archibalds Fantastic Guide to Promises - Must Read

- http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/

9) Four States a Promise Can Have - [Fulfilled (Resolved) | Rejected | Pending | Settled]

9a) Fulfilled (aka Resolved)

- it worked; the action related to the promise succeded

9b) Rejected

- it didn't work; the action related to the promise failed 

9c) Pending

- still waiting; the promise has not been fulfilled or rejected 

9d) Settled

- something happened; the promise either fulfilled or rejected


10) Promises TimeLine - How and When are Promises Executed

- consider what happens in this time line:

10a) start -> event fires -> event listener is set -> time continues

- well nothing happens; we startred listening after the event fired

10b) start -> Promise reolves -> Set action for resolution value -> time continues

- the action for the resolution WILL execute

10c) A Promise Constructor

new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  reslove('hi');  // works
  resolve('bye'); // can't happen a second time
});

- only the 1st resolve settles the promise
- compared to an event which can file MANY times

11) Promises Execute on Main Thread (so are still potentially blcoking)

- if work in promise takes a long time, can block browser from rendering
- JANK!!!!
- not a pass for safely executing long running operations
- simply a technique for deciding what will happen once an asynchronous task settles

11a) Promises <-> Try/Catch Analogy

- think of promises as try/catch wrappers around asynchronuos work

try {
  ...
}
catch {
 ...
}

12) When Should You Consider Using Promises?

- we use promises to wrap asynchronous work
- remember, promises work on the main thread
- so, using then to wrap synchnronous work makes no sense

13) Promises Syntax

new Promise(function(resolve[, reject]) {
  var value = doSomething();
  if (thingWorked) {
    resolve(value);
  }
  else if(somethineWentWrong) {
    reject()'
  }
}).then(function(value) {
  //success!
  return nextThing(value);
}).catch(rejectFunction);


- remember a Promise is a try/catch wrapper around code that will finsih at an unpredictable time

- Promise is a constructor
- you can store the object it returns in a variable; or work on it immediately
- Cam will typically work on it without storing it as a vaiable
- you pass a function to the promise with two arguments (resolve and reject)
- the reject argument is optional

13a) Resolve and Reject

- two callbacks
- used to specify when a promise has resolved or failed
- calling resolve constitutes fulfillment
- calling reject constitutes failure
- when either resolve or reject is called, the promise is settled
- the function passed to .then or .catch is then executed

14) Example: image tag loader

- wrap image tag loader in a Promise because i want to do work after image is laoded

new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  var img = document.createElement('img');
  img.src = 'image.jpg';
  img.onload = resolve; // reslove is called at sometime after loading
  image.onerror = reject; // reject is called someimte after the load attempt
  document.body.appendChild(img);
});
.then(finsihLoading)
.catch(showAlternateImage);

15) Arguments to resolve or reject Callbacks

- arguments passed to reslove will be same as arguments passed to function in .then
- arguments passed to reject will be same as arguments passed to function in .catch
- if nothing is passed to resolve/reject then the function to .thn/.catch recieves undefined

new Promise(function(resolve[, reject]) {
  var value = doSomething();
  if (thingWorked) {
    resolve(value);				--> SAME as value below
  }
  else if(somethineWentWrong) {
    reject()'
  }
}).then(function(value) {			--> SAME as value above
  //success!
  return nextThing(value);
}).catch(rejectFunction);

16) Passing a Promise Object as the Argument to resolve/reject

- the passed promise will execute 1st
- then whatever value it resolves to will be passed to the next link in the chain
- i.e. the next .then or .catch
- resolve leads to the next .then in the chain
- reject leads to the next .catch in the chain

17) Error if Body of Promise -> Call .catch

- if error in body of Promise function, ...
- .catch gets called
- more to come on error handling in lesson 2

18) Quiz: Write Your First Promise (\Quizes\setTimeout) - Wrapping Phase

- this is like a drill execerise for the "Wrapping" phase of using Promises
- create promise to wrap async work (i.e. the setTimeout)
- resolve the promise in setTimeout's callback
- remember the Promise itself works on the main thread

19) Quiz: Wrapping ReadyState (\Quizes\readyState) - Thening Phase

- see class solution; my solution was too simple

20) Document.readState Values [loading | interactive | complete]

- when the value of this property changes a "readystatechange" event fires on the document object

20a) loading

- the document is still loading

20b) interactive (document event fired: DOMContentLoaded)

- the document has been parsed...
- but sub-resources such as images, stylesheets and frames are still loading
- the state indicates that the DOMContentLoaded event has been fired.

20c) complete (document event fired: load)

- the document and all sub-resources have finished loading
- the state indicates that the load event has been fired

20d) Example: Different states of readiness

switch (document.readyState) {
  case "loading":
    // The document is still loading.
    break;
  case "interactive":
    // The document has finished loading. We can now access the DOM elements.
    var span = document.createElement("span");
    span.textContent = "A <span> element.";
    document.body.appendChild(span);
    break;
  case "complete":
    // The page is fully loaded.
    console.log("The first CSS rule is: " + document.styleSheets[0].cssRules[0].cssText);
    break;
}

20e) Example: readystatechange as an alternative to DOMContentLoaded event

// alternative to DOMContentLoaded event
document.onreadystatechange = function () {
  if (document.readyState == "interactive") {
    initApplication();
  }
}

20d) Example: readystatechange as an alternative to load event

// alternative to load event
document.onreadystatechange = function () {
  if (document.readyState == "complete") {
    initApplication();
  }
}

22) Quiz: Wrap an XHR

- starting branch: git checkout xhr-start
- soultion bracnh: git checkout xhr-solution

23) Web Technologies

- this course is about native javascript promises
- they started showing up in browsers at the end of 2014
- but polyfils for promises have been around for alot longer

24) PolyFills - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill

- a browser fallback written in javascript
- it allows functionality you expect to work in modern browsers to work in older browsers
- e.g. to support canvas (an html5 feature) in older browsers

25) jQuery Promises

- $ implements its own version of promises
- they have issues

25a) Issues with jQuery Promises

- You're Missing the Point of Promises - Domenic Denicola
(https://blog.domenic.me/youre-missing-the-point-of-promises/)

- jQuery Deferred Broken - Valerio Gheri
(https://thewayofcode.wordpress.com/tag/jquery-deferred-broken/)

26) Q Style Promises

- they're an implementation of the Promises/A+ spec
(https://promisesaplus.com/)

- $q service Documentation
(https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$q)

26a) Angular 1.x

- uses Q-Style Promises
- mostly thesame as native promises but have some small differences

26b) Angular 2.x

- takes advantage of native javascript promises

27) Browser Support For Native Promises

- as of 2015, most major browsers support native promises
- the exceptions are internet explorer and opera-mini
- so must include a ployfill or some other kind of fallback on your production sites

27a) Browser Implementation

- Can I Use... - Promises: Chart showing browser support
(http://caniuse.com/#search=promises)

- ES2015 Promises Polyfill
(https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise)

- Q Library
(https://github.com/kriskowal/q)

- Bluebird Promises
(https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird)

28) The Service Worker API - http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/

- takes advantage of native promises
- service workers are total game changers
- they allow you to add a powerful layer of control between you app and the network
- this means you can create apps that work offline

28a) Service Worker vs. Web Worker vs. Web Socket
 https://aarontgrogg.com/blog/2015/07/20/the-difference-between-service-workers-web-workers-and-websockets/

29) The Fetch API - https://davidwalsh.name/fetch

- uses native promises to simplify XMLHttpRequests (XHRs)

30) Quiz: Fetch API

- using XHR directly is a pain
- so, the fetch API is an abstraction on XHRs to hide some complexity
- current support: chrome, firefox, opera, android browsers
- it uses native promises

30a) Instructions

- checkout the fetch-start branch and navigate to app/scripts/app.js
- rewrite get with the Fetch API: https://davidwalsh.name/fetch
- finish the getJSON() method, which should take a URL and return the parsed JSON response
- getJSON() needs to return a Promise!
- test by logging the response and by passing the query string from getJSON() to addSearchHeader()
- handle errors by passing 'unknown' to addSearchHeader() and logging them
- checkout the fetch-solution branch to see my code

31) Chaining Promises

doSomething1(arg1)
.then(function(arg2) {
  return arg2.result; 	// this is the Promise return by the 1st then
			// when it resolves, then next then in the chain is run

			// so I return a promise that was created by a library function
			// then it is the responsiblity of api to resolve/reject promise

			// or I can explicity create and return a promise myself
			// then I must resolve/reject the promise myself
})
.then(function(arg3) {
  console.log(arg3);	// last then in the chain does/returns nothing 
});

32) What Happens Next?

- .then's also return promises
- so you can .then of another .then

32a) Thenables

- this term is used to describe promises and .thens
- "Thenable" used in context of promises on MDN
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise#Methods)

32b) What is a Thenable?

- any method or object that returns a .then (promises, .then's, .catch's)
- any thenable can become part of a chain of asynchronous work

33) Passing Information Between Asynchronuos Methods in a Chain 

- when creating a chain of asynchronuous work, 
- each subsequent link in the chain receives either:

i) the fullfiled value of the previous promise, 

new Promise(function(resolve) {
    setTimeout(function(){
    resolve("Done");
  }, 1000);
}).then(function(msg){
  console.log(msg);  // Done
  return new Promise(function(resolve) { resolve("Message From Promise"); });
}).then(function(msg){
  console.log(msg); // Message From Promise
});

ii) or the return value of the previous .then

new Promise(function(resolve) {
    setTimeout(function(){
    resolve("Done");
  }, 1000);
}).then(function(msg){
  console.log(msg);  // Done
  return "Message From Then";
}).then(function(msg){
  console.log(msg); // Message From Then
});

- note the 2nd .then still executes even if the 1st .then returns nothing
- in this case the arg of the 2nd .then is undefined

33a) Chaining Thenables

- an incredibly powerful technique for simplifying complex sequences of asynchronous work
- practice a few chaining strategies in the next lesson
