1) Mozilla Developer Network has a great article on HTML and the DOM. 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction

2) Web Platform.org also has some pretty complete tutorials on CSS.
https://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css

3) Want to learn more about the critical rendering path? Check out Website Performance Optimization, taught by Cameron and Ilya Grigorik, a performance engineer at Google.

4) Checkout README.md for the frontend-nanodegree-resume project

5) The Resume HTML
- Structured with a bunch of div tags which the javascript will be later referencing

<div id="main">
<div id="header">
<div id="workExperience">
<div id="projects">
<div id="education">
<div id="skills chart">

Idea is instead of harding coding the content of the html page, the page initial exists as a template, and the content details will be filled in programmatically when a user request the page (i guess by client side javascript).

Will be using the template strategy for this class

6) HTML file's javascript
- Link to javascript file in the head section like usual.
- However, there are also script tags at the bottom of the body section
- The js script in the body is what changes the html on the page

7) Resume Page Overview
Section 1: "Hello World!!!"
Section 2: Empty resume sections
Section 3: The JavaScript

8) General representation of how resume will look in a browser

Hello world!
  [Header]
    Work Experience
    Projects
    Education
    Skills Chart
  [footer]

The javascript will check of any of your sections contain content and if not, 
the js hides the section

if(section.content === "") {
  hideSection();
}

9) Some JS resources
jQuery: http://jquery.com/
MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

10) JS console
- See console tab in developer tools
- when you see "undefined" just means the function you ran does not return anything

11) jQuery syntax
$("") - this syntax is only used for jQuery; it is how you create a jQuery Object

12) append()
Use jQuery append method to add new html as a child of an existing html element.
i.e. $("#header").append("some text")
