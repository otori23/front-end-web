0) Goal

- Optimize JS

1) JS Compiler - just in time (JIT)

- JIT compiler convert your js source into assembly type langauge for the browser's js engine
- the JIT compiler optimizes your js bit by bit as it runs so that it is as fast as possible
- JIT compilers are brilliant and extremely complicated
- chrome's js engine is called V8

1a) JIT consequences

- no way to look at js source and know exactly what runs in js engine

1b) irhydra - http://mrale.ph/irhydra/2/

- this is a tool that can display intermediate representations used by V8 and Dart VM optimizing compilers
- i.e. can see the assembly type coe that JIT will pass along to js engine

1c) Micro-optimization

- this is where you try and write code you think will be a little bit faster for the browser to run

- e.g. try to decide between

for(var i = 0; i < len; i==)...     --or--      while(++i < len)...

- there is now way to know how the JIT compiler will optimize your code...
- so, micro-optimization is generally a waste time
 
1d) Upshot

- However, there are plenty of things you can do to make you JS run better

2) artifact

- something observed in a scientific investigation or experiment that is not naturally present but occurs as a result of the preparative or investigative procedure.
