0) Goal

- remember not all style changes are equal
- different style changes will trigger different parts of the render pipeline
- some will trigger layout -> paint -> composite
- some will trigger paint -> composite
- some will trigger composite

0a) Optimize Paint and Composite

- the goal of this section is to learn how to optimize last two steps in pipeline

0b) Remember csstriggers.clm 

- provides a breakdown of how styles affect the rendering pipeline
- if you are wondering whether the thing you are want to animate will trigger layout, paint, composite ???
- check out this site

0c) Paint is expensive

- paint is one of the fastests ways to kill your fps
- try to avoid during animations

1) Paint Rectangles Quiz

- paint problems are likely to be way worse than any other performace bottleneck you are likely to hit

1a) Investigating Paint in Timeline

- in timeline open the "drawer"
- select the Rendering tab
- check "Show paint rectangles" option
- now as you interact with page (e.g. scroll), components that invoke paint light up in green

1b) Paint Profiler

- like the JS profiler
- check this option to give more details about paint in timeline chart 
- see the summary panel/tab for the Paint Profiler
- use to measure and bust paint jank

1c) Paint Profiler tab in timeline

- whole new timeline showing details of paint 
- select a paint record in the main thread to see its details
- can see list of paint commands for selected paint record in main thread
- can also see what part of page got painted for the selected paint record
- if you limit the timeline for the selected paint record in the main thread, you can see ONLY what was painted then
- so you can see what the browser is painting at different points

2) Compositing - side nav example

- say you have a page and you want to bring out a side nav

2a) Option one - paint sidenav when needed

- have one layer in memory
- then redraw the pixels for the side nav when it is needed
- need to re-paint for every frame of animation
- not good as we are constatnly painting

2b) Option two - use multiple layers (store nav and call it up when needed)

- have one layer with the page contents
- have another layer with the side nav
- slide the side nav on-top of the page when it is needed
- NO painting is done
- nav bar slides in when hamburger icon is clicked

3) Conceptual Question about Layers Quiz - Sketch Book Pro

- at Udacity they use SketchBook pro to create drawings
- use layers to make it easy to separate and edit different parts of a drawing
- layers are a way to manage a complex drawing

4) Composite Layers
