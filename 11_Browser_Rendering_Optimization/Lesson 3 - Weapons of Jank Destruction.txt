0) Goal

- use chrome dev tools to identify and destroy jank
- in particular will be using the timeline in dev tools
- will use the time line to determine exactly where jank is happenning

1) DevTools

- Ctrl-Shift-i

2) Timeline

- allows you to trak frames per seconds (fps) for your project
- recording in the timeline shows your fps information
- also, for each frame, you see what work was involved
- the work involved ties back into the pipeline from last lesson

2a) Frames view

- like bar chart showing fps vs time

2b) Thread workers

- e.g. Main thread, Composititor thread
- shows work done vs time
- underneath frame view
- can see how we spent our time in each frame?
- when you select a block you can see detials ot the block showing the exact parts of render pipeline being processed
- js, style calculations, layout, layer management, paint and composite

2c) jank related

- you can see where you are hitting jank
- i.e. where you are not getting at least 60 fps

2d) references

- demo site
(http://www.html5rocks.com/static/demos/parallax/demo-1a/demo.html)

- timeline reference
(https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/timeline)

3) The Timeline in Depth

- Note that the timeline records are color coded
- Blue: HTML being parsed; normally really fast not a performace bottle neck
- Purple: Recalculate Styles and Layout
- Green: Paint and Compisite
- Yellow: JS

3a) Timeline views

- can toggle on/off the bar chart showing fps vs time information (probably want it on all the time)
- for view of work being done on threads, can toogle between two views
- flame chart and waterfall - both show same information
- severs to show what action trigger what other action - i.e. relationship between actions browser is taking

3b) Thread work - Flame chart view

- default view
- bars grow down from the top
- if one action triggers another, the triggered action is shown as a bar underneath its parent

3c) Waterfall view

- scroll up/down
- tap on records on left hand side
- the wider a bar, the longer it took tast to complete

4) Identifying Jank Sample - Weight Tracker app

- live site: http://weight.aerotwist.com/
- github: https://github.com/paullewis/weight-tracker
- the life site is performant - so no jank
- take timeline trace of what happens when you expand/collapse hamburger icon
- analyze trace to identify jank
- select work block to view details
