1) Set up Development Environment

- typically means setting up your Editor
- the right tools can make your experience much less frustrating

2) Integrated Development Environments - IDEs

- like a development productivitiy swiss army knife
- can do many things: editing, building, debugging, compiling, optimizing
- the trade off is that there are more specialized tools that to a better job doing just ONE thing

3) Native Development Tends To Use IDEs

- vendor controls language and development environments

-   Apple: 	Xcode
- Android: 	Android Studio
- Windows:	Visual Studio

4) Development on The Web

- due to different browsers, devices, and standards
- most web developers use individual tools specialized for doing one job
- and they make sure these tools work well together

5) The Sublime Editor

- reason being that it is popular, dependable, extensible, fast, and well supported by its community
 
5a) The Atom Editor

- also a good choice
- new kid on the block

6) Built In Editor Magic

- in the first couple of days of using a new editor, ...
- try out lots of build-in shortcuts and features, even if they seem overkill
- try them all out and observe yourself
- which shortcuts stick, which do you have to force yourself to use?

7) Sublime Shortcuts - On Mac

- CMD + T -> Fuzzy File Finder
