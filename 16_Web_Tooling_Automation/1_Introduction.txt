1) Not All Optimizations are Worth Doing

- ask yourself how long will it take to implement?
- how much time will I save using the optimization after it is implemented
- if the time saved using the optimaztion is far greater than the time spent implementing it, then go ahead and do it
- else, don't do it

2) Avoid the Following

- building a better tool from scratch
- using obscure not well supported libraries
 (e.g. some random build tool vs Gulp)
- tools that claim to do it all and have no well defined API for extension or interfacing
