Building the Home Town App, part 3 of 3

1. Update the sports score table with your favorite sports team (make sure it's responsive!).

2. Double check your text. Is it too long? If so, make it fit more naturally.

3. Add a minor breakpoint if possible.

4. Try replacing a few of the images with responsive images. Check out the responsive images section of Web fundamentals (https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/media/images/)

5. Share your final project in the forums.
