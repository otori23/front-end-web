1) Intro

- forget every thing you just learned and use a scaffolding tool (yo anyone?)
- well, not exactly
- all your projects are going to be pretty much setup thesame way
- i.e. your folder structure, gulpfile, gulp plugins, etc will be mostly thesame
- settin up the project and writing thesame gulp file over and over again is inefficient
- so, you want to automate the automation

2) Scaffolding

- a way of create a starting point structure for your project ...
- based on a few assumption that you control

3) Most Basic form of Scaffodling

- copy and paste
- perfectly valid, but not elegant
- want to use a scafolding tool

4) Scaffolding Tools

- HTML5 BoilerPlate 	: Simplest
- Web Starter Kit	: Intermediate
- Yeoman		: Advanced

5) HTML5 Boiler Plate

https://html5boilerplate.com/

- all it does is give you a decent basis for your CSS, HTML, and JavaScript
- makes sure your HTML is well formed
- fall backs are provided
- your css is normalized
- load jquery and other convienent libraries in the html
- provides a simple build script to combine and minify files


6) Web Starter Kit

https://developers.google.com/web/tools/starter-kit/

- built at Google
- proposes and opinionated starting point, includes:
- a build configuration with live editing, etc
- won't be a good fit for every propject out there

7) Yeoman

http://yeoman.io/

- for advanced user - i.e. you
- offers the most flexibility
- use it with generators

7a) $yo webapp

- call yeoman with the webapp generator
- prompts will ask you for what you need, then it create a project based on your preferences
- think of it as a much fancier version of copy & paste

8) Outro

- now that you know all the basics of automating your development and build process, ...
- you are in position to understand and customize the outputs of the scaffolding tools 

9) Summary: What did we accomplish

- setup our editor to code like a pro
- got familiar with gulp
- dramatically improved workflow with live editing
- setup safety nets for easier teamwork and better quality control
- optimize production version of site which will be shipped to users
