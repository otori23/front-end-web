0) Critical Rendering Path
- https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/
- steps broswers goes through to convert html/css/js into pixels on the screen
- optimize this process to make pages render faster = happy users

- need to understand how browser consumes html/css/js in rder to understand how to optimize browser performance
- i.e. the redering pipeline or CRP as he puts it

1) Summary CRP
- see crp.jpeg
- grab html and build DOM
- grab css and build CSSOM
- combine DOM and CSSOM to create render tree
- layout the page (i.e. figure out where everything goes on the page)
- then, finally, paint pixels on the actual screen
- js is an important component of performance model - will add this detail later

2) Converting HTML to the DOM
- crp well defined set of steps browser follows to turn html into the DOM
- HTML specification contians rules for how to process received data from html request
- Characters -> Tokens -> Nodes -> DOM

- DOM is a tree structure that captures the content and properties of the html and relationships between the nodes
- the browser constructs the DOM incrementally
- we can take advantage of this to speed up the rendering of our pages
- in fact, this is something the google search pages do really really well

2a) HTML -> DOM references
- check out the demo page in this example
(http://udacity-crp.herokuapp.com/cssom.html)

- what is the Document Object Model?
(http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/introduction.html)

- how the Document Object Model is constructed
(https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/constructing-the-object-model#document-object-model-dom)

- the HTML5 Specification
(http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/)

2b) HTML -> DOM summary 
<html><head><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"><link href="style.css" ...

- Characters (in html) -> Tokens -> Nodes -> DOM
- html text contained within angle brackets has special meaning and is said to be a tag
- browser has a tokenizer process/thread running
- tokenizer emits tokens as it enconters start and end tags (i.e. <> and </>)
- another process in the browser consumes these tokens and converts them to node objects

[StartTag: HTML] [StartTag: head] [Tag: meta] [Tag: link] [EndTag: head]
[StartTag: body] [StartTag: p] [Hello,] [StartTag: span] [web performance]
[EndTag: span] ...

- see dom.jpeg (top flow is for client; bottom flow is for server)

2) Fast Google Search Responses
- the browser does not have to wait for all the html to arrive before processing begins
- also, the server does not have to wait for the search results before sending html to browser on client

2a) Google search: Incremental html delivery
- when you send a seatch request to google, the server does something really clever
- before server knows what the search results are, it sends back the header of the (response) page
- header is thesame for all users
- this allows the client browser to processing response and begin constructing the DOM incrementally
- the browser can even render the header
- when the search results are ready, the rest of the html arrives
- browser use this html to update the DOM -> then render it too

- see Flushing the Document Early to learn more.
(http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/05/18/flushing-the-document-early/)

- also, check out Chunk Scatter, a fantastic tool for visualizing chunked HTTP responses.
- may explain how to read Timeline charts in developer tools
(http://blog.cowchimp.com/chunk-scatter-http-chunked-response-analysis-tool/)

2c) How Google developers measure and optimize the performance of their pages
- chrome developer tools and mobile debuging

3) Exploring Timeline Traces
- Timeline in developer tools is giving us a low level view of what the browser is doing as it builds a page
- can record a trace on the timeline for requests from and responses to browser
- see the "Records" portion of the Timeline
- this pane shows each step in CRP
- many different events shown on Timeline; can be overwhelming at first

3a) To learn more about the Timeline panel in Chrome Developer Tools
- Performance profiling with the Timeline
(https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/timeline)

- Timeline event reference
(https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/timeline#timeline-event-reference)

3b) CNN's Timeline Trace
- Ctrl+Shift+I: open the DevTools.
- Ctrl+Shift+R: reload the page and capture the timeline.
- use drawer icon in developer tools tool bar to open window with [Console, Search, Emulation, Rendering] options
- ESC key works too to toogle show/hide 
- in Emulation tab, can select a device to emulate
- can use 'dock' icon to rearrange screen (i.e. device on left; dev tools on right)
- can drill into more details of Records (i.e. request/response events) by selecting a particular record
- can filter events

4) Converting CSS to the CSSOM
- DOM capture content of page, but...
- need a description of HOW to display the page
- Enter the CSS objeject model
- CSS has its own specification on valid tokens
- CSSOM is built by browser much in same way as the DOM
- Characters (in css) -> Tokens -> Nodes -> DOM

4a) Sample CSS
body { gond-size: 16px} p {font-weight: bold} span {color: read}
p span {display: none} img {float: right}

- see cssom.jpeg

4b) CSSOM
- note data in CSSOM, p span an dimg are children of body
- this is because all visible content are childern of body, according to CSS specitication
- also, note, p span, indicates a span node is added as a child of the p node
- a CSSOM node inherits the styling rules off all its ancestors
- see cssom.jpeg
- similar to, but no same as DOM construction because CSS rules cascade down

4c) Inctemental processing
- for html, the browser does not need to have the whole DOM tree constructed before it starts rendering the page
- HOWEVER, for css the browser needs the entire CSSOM constructed before it can use teh CSSOM
- no partial css tree

4d) Partial CSS tree
- css allows user to redefine style prperties of elements, e.g.

p { ... }
...
p { ... }

- so, a partial css dom tree would not include the overriden style for p in the snippet above
- you would end up using the wrong style
- browser BLOcKS rendering until it receives and processes all of the css

- see cssom_partial.jpeg 

- CSS IS RENDER BLOCKING

4e) CSSOM references
- Learn more about how CSS Object Model is constructed
(https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/constructing-the-object-model#css-object-model-cssom)

- Learn more about why and how CSS blocks rendering
(https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/render-blocking-css)

5) Which style is faster to evaluate
- The more general selector is actually easier to evaluate.
- the more specific rul is more expensive because browser has to traverse more nodes in CSS DOM tree
- more specific css rules probably not your performance bottle neck
- HOWEVER, measure first, then optimize later

- see faster.jpeg

6) Recalculating CSS Styles in DevTools
- can save a Timeline trace
- right click on trace and select save
- can also load trace in a similar way

6a) Examine css events in trace
- can see the 1st css request going out; part of 1st parse HTML (see request for style.css)
- happens after 1st chunk of html is recieved
- this is where browser fount link tag and initiated http request for style.css
- wait to get css bytes...
- then later see the Recalculate style event
- this is where we convert the css response into the css object model
- look at summary pane to see how lone it took to complete this step
- before you re-write all you css rules; measure this time and see how long building 
your cssom takes
- i.e. measure 1st, then optimize if needed

7) The Render Tree
- captures both the page content and the styles
- it is a combination of the information in the HTML dom and the CSS dom
- html dom: contents; css dom: styles
- captures only visible content 
- non-visible content does not make its way into the render tree
- remember css properties of nodes in css dom, cascade down





HOW TO RENDER FASTER
- use partial HTML DOM
- use more general css rules - actually, DOES NOT impact performance that much
