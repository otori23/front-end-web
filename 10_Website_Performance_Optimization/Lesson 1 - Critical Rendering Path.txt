0) Critical Rendering Path
- https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/
- steps broswers goes through to convert html/css/js into pixels on the screen
- optimize this process to make pages render faster = happy users

1) Summary CRP
- see crp.jpeg
- grab html and build DOM
- grab css and build CSSOM
- combine DOM and CSSOM to create render tree
- layout the page (i.e. figure out where everything goes on the page)
- then, finally, paint pixels on the actual screen
- js is an important component of performance model - will add this detail later

2) Converting HTML to the DOM
- crp well defined set of steps browser follows to turn html into the DOM
- HTML specification contians rules for how to process received data from html request
- Characters -> Tokens -> Nodes -> DOM

- DOM is a tree structure that captures the content and properties of the html and relationships between the nodes
- the browser constructs the DOM incrementally
- we can take advantage of this to speed up the rendering of our pages
- in fact, this is something the google search pages do really really well

2a) HTML -> DOM references
- check out the demo page in this example
(http://udacity-crp.herokuapp.com/cssom.html)

- what is the Document Object Model?
(http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/introduction.html)

- how the Document Object Model is constructed
(https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/constructing-the-object-model#document-object-model-dom)

- the HTML5 Specification
(http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/)

2b) HTML -> DOM summary 
<html><head><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"><link href="style.css" ...

- Characters (in html) -> Tokens -> Nodes -> DOM
- html text contained within angle brackets has special meaning and is said to be a tag
- browser has a tokenizer process/thread running
- tokenizer emits tokens as it enconters start and end tags (i.e. <> and </>)
- another process in the browser consumes these tokens and converts them to node objects

[StartTag: HTML] [StartTag: head] [Tag: meta] [Tag: link] [EndTag: head]
[StartTag: body] [StartTag: p] [Hello,] [StartTag: span] [web performance]
[EndTag: span] ...

- see dom.jpeg

2c) Fast Google Search Responses
- the browser does not have to wait for all the html to arrive before processing begins
- also, the server does not have to wait for the search results before sending html to browser on client
