1) DOM & CSSOM
- these steps are typically the worst offenders
- they are what really makes you browser renpder a page slowly

1a) How to make faster
- server sends html to client as quickly as possible
- small file sizes for html

1b) Steps
- Minify: use minification to remove extra white space and comments
- Compress: 
- Cached: by browser

2) Unblocking CSS - Why wait on styles you don't need
- to optimize cssom construction
- remove unneccessary styles, minify, compress, cache
- also need to consider render blocking css
- remember the browser needs to get all the page's css and build the cssom before building render tree
- you don't want to paint an unstyled page, thus the render blocking css

3) Unblocking CSS with Media Queries

- CSS allows us to scope styles to particular conditions

<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">

body { font-size: 16px } // Always applies

@media screen and (orientation: landscape) { // In Landscape: float menu to the right
  .menu { float: right }
}

@media print { // On print of page: resize body to use smaller font size
  body {font-size: 12px }
}

- media queries are important for responsive web design, but...
- how do they help with optimizing crp (unblocking css)

3a) How media queries help with optimizing css?
- say a browser is rendering a page using the css above 
- ordinarily, browser blocks rendering until it parses all the styles
- should browser block rendering on print rule?
- if you are not printing, then probably not
- so, it makes sensce to split your css into mulitple files - based on conditions need to apply rule in file
- so, now linking to two files in html

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style-print.css">

- by default the browser assumes that each style sheet is render blocking
- however, can tell the browser when the style sheet should be applied by using the "media" attribute on the link tag

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style-print.css" media="print">

- when the browser sees this style sheet, it knows that it only needs to apply it for printing
- so don't block rendering when loading on the phone
- browser still downloads both style sheets, but rendering is not blocked on style-print.css

- see renderBlockingCSS.jpeg

4) JavaScript and the CRP - Optimizing JS
- still want to minify, compress, and cache
- PageSpeed Insights may still complain about parser blocking scripts

4a) Parser blocking scripts - meaning and how to optimize
- folder, hello_world contains sample web pabe with inline js
- the js in the sample page manipulates the DOM and CSSOM
- can do more to optimize this js
- but optimizing js can be itw own course
- in this exaample can optimize how the code is included on the page
 
5) Quiz: How will the text be rendered?

<p>
  Awesome page
  <script>
    document.write(" with JavaScript ");
  </script>
  is awesome
</p>

- first document parser creates a p node and adds a text fragment
- then it encounters the script tag, 
- at which point it pauses DOM construction
- waits for js enginge to execute the script
- script appends with js " with JavaScript ", then exits
- now, resume DOM construction
- document parser appends "is awesome"

Final Result: Awesome page with JavaScript is awesome

5a) Document.write()
Writes a string of text to a document stream opened by document.open().

Note: as document.write writes to the document stream, 
calling document.write on a closed (loaded) document automatically calls document.open 
which will clear the document.

6)  External JavaScript Dependencies - how js affects performance
- note sequence of steps
- when script tag was encountered, 
- had to pause DOM construction and let js run before we could continue
- DOM -> JS -> DOM

- We say, js is PARSER BLOCKING: i.e. DOM construciton is parsed when script tag is encountered

6a) External JS files

- say we had this instead:

<p>
  Awesome page
  <script src="write.js"></script>
  is awesome
</p>

write.js:

document.write(" with JavaScript ");

- when parser sees script tag, it has to go fetch the file from its remote location
- this fetch could take a while,
- and the browser is blocked and can't continue DOM construction
- in turn, this slows down the CRP

- So inlining is always quicker
- but may want to use external files for shared js

7) More on JavaScript Dependencies

- how does parser handle the documnet below

<style src="style.css" />   // -> p { color: black }
<p>
  Awesome page
  <script>
    var e = document.getElementsByTagName("p")[0];
    e.style.color = "red";
  </script>
  is awesome
</p>

- note, the css says color all p text as black
- js says, color the 1st p text as red

7a) How browser processes - see process.jpeg

- browser requests html
- as soon as it gets the response
- it starts building the DOM
- discovers css and sends a request for it
- parser continues and finds script tag
- at this point, the praser has to block... why?
- parser does not know what script will do
- script may want to access css properties
- so, script execution is blocked until css arrives and cssom is built
- then js runs
- and parser finishes building the DOM

7b) CSS is bottle neck
- css blocks rendering and js execution
- OPTIMIZING CSS IS SO IMPORTANT

8) Async Javascript
- some scripts DO NOT modify the DOM or CSSOM (e.g. analytics) 
- so, they should not block rendering
- how do we flag these types of scripts to the browser

8a) window.onload
- one strategy: load the script after the page is loaded
- so, when browser fires onload event, you execute the script then

8b) use async attribute on script tag 
- tells browser not to block DOM construction when browser encounters script tag
- i.e. 
<head>
  ...
  <script src="analytics.js" async></script>
</head>

- also, browser does not block on CSSOM construction; 
- i.e. if CSSOM is NOT ready, script still runs

8c) async attribute
- js does not block CRP

8d) inline scripts
- will always block on the CSSOM
- with one exception
- if you put your inline js above the css
- then this js will execute without

9) JavaScript approaches
- Blocking: <script src="anExteralScript.js"></script>
- Inline: <script>document.write("this is an inline script")</script>
- Async: <script async src="anExternalScript.js"></script>
