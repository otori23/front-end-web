TL;DR

Inventory all own and third party assets on your pages
Measure the performance of each asset: its value and its technical performance
Determine if the resources are providing sufficient value

1) Website Resources
 
- the fastest and best optimized resource is a resource not sent. 

- as a performance engineer, it is your job to always maintain a critical eye for any opportunity to eliminate unnecessary resources from your application. 

- it’s a good practice to question, and periodically revisit, the implicit and explicit assumptions with your team.

- all too frequently our pages contain resources which are unnecessary, or worse, hinder page performance without delivering much value to the visitor or the site they are hosted on. 

2) Measure

- measure what users are using on your page and make a decision on what resources to keep vs what to remove.

- while eliminating unnecessary downloads seems like a trivial statement, in practice it is anything but, as it often requires a lot of careful thinking and measurement to make the call. 

- in fact, for best results you should periodically inventory and revisit these questions for each and every asset on your pages.
