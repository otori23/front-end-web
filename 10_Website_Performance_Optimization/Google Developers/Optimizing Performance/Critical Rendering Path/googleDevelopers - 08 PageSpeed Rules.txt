Main Goal is to:
Eliminate render-blocking JavaScript and CSS

1) Optimize JavaScript Use

- Prefer async JavaScript resources
- Avoid synchronous server calls
- Defer parsing JavaScript
- Avoid long running JavaScript

2) Optimize CSS Use

- Put CSS in the document head: download critical resources as quickly as possible
- Avoid CSS imports: imports increase round trip time; cannot download in parallel
- Inline render-blocking CSS: if css needed for rendering don't waste time on a roundtrip
